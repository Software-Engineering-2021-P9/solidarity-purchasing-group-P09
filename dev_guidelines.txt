This document lists all the rules developers must follow during development.

YOU HAVE TO STICK TO THE RULES, NO PR WILL BE ACCEPTED IF SOMETHING IS AGAINST THEM.

COMMON:
- You have to STICK on the design made at the start of the sprint. If you find a problem, leave a comment on the design task and SHOUT on the Telegram group.
- Before defining a new method or a new service which can be shared, ask on the Telegram group if someone already did it.

BACK END:
- Before start implementing an API, provide a mock implementation which returns fixed data so the front end devs can use it. 
  You have to create a PR for that, ask to someone for the review. After acceptance you can create another branch and start implementing the real API.
  E.g. 
	1.1. 	Create mock API in a branch named like "feat-mock-{APIName}"
	1.2. 	Start working on the real implementation on a branch named like "feat-{APIName}"
	2. 	Ask for review
	3. 	Merge it
	4. 	Notify front end developer
- Every new API must be tested for the success case and at least for the more probable failure cases.

FRONT END:
- Please, when developing front end components, stick to a project folder layout like this:
	root
  		- src
     			- ui-components (must contain custom buttons, containers,… everything used in pages)
     			- pages (the components containing the full page)
			- services (all the logic that can be shared between components or model specific methods)
- Each component and page should have it’s own css file.
- Please follow the format of the example api request for every other method you add in the APIClient service.
- If a model you need is not implemented, look at the api definitions and implement it as the example model provided.
- Try not to change the layout, if you can’t stick to it let all of us know.
