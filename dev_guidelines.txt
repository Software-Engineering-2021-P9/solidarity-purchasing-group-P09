This document lists all the rules developers must follow during development.

YOU HAVE TO STICK TO THE RULES, NO PR WILL BE ACCEPTED IF SOMETHING IS AGAINST THEM.

COMMON:
- You have to STICK on the design made at the start of the sprint. If you find a problem, leave a comment on the design task and SHOUT on the Telegram group.

BACK END:
- Before defining a new method (e.g. for database access) or a new service which can be shared, ask on the Telegram group if someone already did it.
- Before start implementing an API, provide a mock implementation which returns fixed data so the front end devs can use it. 
  You have to create a PR for that, ask to someone for the review. After acceptance you can create another branch and start implementing the real API.
  E.g. 
	1.1. 	Create mock API in a branch named like "feat-mock-{APIName}"
	1.2. 	Start working on the real implementation on a branch named like "feat-{APIName}"
	2. 	Ask for review
	3. 	Merge it
	4. 	Notify front end developer
